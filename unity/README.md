# Unity Frontend
The frontend is created in Unity. It is responsable for displaying different shopping stores with its item locations in a 3D world. The shopping list is also created here and the result of the calculation is presented. Thus the Unity application represents both the start and end point of the distributed application.


## Features
- Visual mapping of the shops with item locations.
- Generation of an abstract representation of a shop for the alogrithm.
- Provision of an UI for creating a shopping list.
- Starting the alogrithm by transferring the data to the scheduler.
- Visualization of the result.


## Installation and Execution
To start the Unity Frontend just execute the compiled files.
The system requirements are defined by the engine itself [here](https://unity3d.com/de/unity/system-requirements).

#### Debung and Develop
To develop and debug the application, the [Unity Editor](https://unity.com) is required. After installing it, just open the Unity-Project (the folder in which this readme is in) with the editor. Using the *Play* icon in the upper center of the editor, the application can be started as if it were running as a stand-alone application.

**Note**: The Unity project is based on the Unity version `2019.2.11f1`. 
If this version is not available in the hub, you can download it from the [Download Archive](https://unity3d.com/de/get-unity/download/archive).
