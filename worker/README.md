## Installation and execution
It is a classic Java program where you don't have to look at so much. If you copy or clone the Worker folder, you can open it with IntelliJ (or Eclipse) and simply start it with the "Run" button. You may have to run the SDK setup first (automatically suggested by IntelliJ in the upper right corner).
